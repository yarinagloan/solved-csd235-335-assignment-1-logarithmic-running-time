For this assignment you will add a recursive binary search algorithm to the existing starter code provided in Canvas. Once you get your code running, you will use it to compare the growth rate of a linear search vs. a binary search algorithm for data sets of increasing sizes.

Add your code to locations in LwtSearch.java, and SearchExamples.java that are marked with a single line comment (“//”) delimiter followed by the string “TODO”. You may add methods and fields to this class, but do not change the signature or return type of LwtSearch.linearSearch or LwtSearch.binarySearch.

<h2>The Output</h2>

Create a Java project named Searching, using the starter files. Before you add any code, run the project and notice the format of the output. The output from your binary search method should follow the same pattern.
